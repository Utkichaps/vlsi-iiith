# Experiment Project Documentation

## Introduction

This document captures the technical details related to the experiment development.

## Project 
**Domain name:** Computer Science & Engineering.    
**Lab name:** Very Large Scale Integration.    
**Experiment name:** Schematic Design Of Transistor Level XOR and XNOR gate.    

Pass transistor logic (PTL) describes several logic families used in the design of integrated circuits. It reduces the count of transistors used to make different logic gates, by eliminating redundant transistors. Transistors are used as switches to pass logic levels between nodes of a circuit, instead of as switches connected directly to supply voltages.   

This reduces the number of active devices, but has the disadvantage that the difference of the voltage between high and low logic levels decreases at each stage. Each transistor in series is less saturated at its output than at its input.   

This experiment is used to simulate the working of an XOR and XNOR gate using pass transistor logic. A graph is generated which shows the output of the simulation.

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to convert XOR and XNOR gate simulation from Java to Javascript.

## Process Followed to convert the experiment 

1. Understand the assigned experiment Java simulation.
2. Understanding the experiment concept.
3. Re-implement the same in javascript.

## Value Added by our Project   

It is beneficial to engineering students who want to understand how pass transistor logic can be used to simulate universal gates and to understand the theory behind it as well.

## Risks and Challenges

A few challenges faced during the development process was understanding the simcir library so that it can be used to retrieve the circuit data dynamically. Adding components was also an issue.

## Issues

No current issues open.
