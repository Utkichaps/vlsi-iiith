For now the UI(undeveloped) is in the Canvastest.html file.
The UI can be simulated there. Will add more functionality.

The Waveform Simulator can be run by clicking finalSimulator.html

I plan to add proper UI to the mainCavas file and then combine it with the simulator file to make the Simulator.
Once that is done by me the simulator will be ready.
