# Project Documentation

## Introduction

This document captures the instructions to run the simulation.

## Instructions:

1. Click on the simLayout.html file to see the simulator.

2. Choose what you want to simulate under the _Select the simulation_ heading.

3. Now you can either see the circuit for positive and negative level pass transistor or follow the procedure to design it.

4. The multiplexer circuit can be designed through the procedure as well.

5. Clicking on the procedure tab will open a procedure window on the right. Click on the _Select the circuit_ heading to see the procedure for each circuit.

6. Click on the _Simulator Help_ heading to see instructions on how to use the simulator.

7. Once your circuit is done, click on the _Simulate_ button to observe the waveform below the workspace.

8. To read the theory behind the experiment click on the _Project Documentation_ heading.
