## Introduction

This document captures the instructions to run the simulation.

## Instructions:

### Circuit Simulator:

1. Click on one of the options under the _See simulation:_ heading to see the circuit on the workspace.

2. Click on clear workspace to clear the simulation space.

3. Click on simulator help to know how to use the simulator.

4. Click on Project Documentation to learn the theory behind the experiment.

5. Click on Simulator to go to waveform simulator.

### Waveform Simulator:

1. Click on the __Help__ button to know how to operate the simulator.

2. Choose the clock type first.

3. Choose either a preset waveform or make your own waveform.

4. Click simulate.

5. After clicking simulate you have to clear the current simulation first before moving on to the next simulation.
