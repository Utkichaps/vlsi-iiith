# Experiment Project Documentation

## Introduction

This document captures the technical details related to the experiment development.

## Project 
**Domain name:** Computer Science & Engineering.    
**Lab name:** Very Large Scale Integration.    
**Experiment name:** Design of D FLip Flop.    

The D flip-flop tracks the input, making transitions which match those of the input D. The D stands for "data"; this flip-flop stores the value that is on the data line. It can be thought of as a basic memory cell. A D flip-flop can be made from a set/reset flip-flop by tying the set to the reset through an inverter. The result may be clocked.    

This experiment is used to simulate the working of a D Flip-Flop circuit wise. It can also be used with a custom input waveform to observe the output of the circuit.

## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to convert the D Flip-flop experiment simulation from Java to Javascript

## Process Followed to convert the experiment 

1. Understand the assigned experiment Java simulation.
2. Understanding the experiment concept.
3. Re-implement the same in javascript.

## Value Added by our Project

It is beneficial to engineering students who want to understand the inner working of the D Flip-Flop and observe the simulated graph with a custom input waveform.

## Risks and Challenges

A few challenges faced during the development process was integrating the wavedrom and checking the waveform for any issues.

## Issues

In Firefox, in the waveform simulator, when you click on the help button the graph is not displayed in the help section.
