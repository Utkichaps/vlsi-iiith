                <h3><a href="index.php" style="margin-left:275px">Very Large Scale Integration</a></h3>

			<p>A single chip sized of few millimeters may have Millions of transistors in it for example a microprocessor is a VLSI device.
			Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) is the process of creating integrated circuits by combining large numbers of transistors into a single chip.			<br>

			<br>
			This lab provides good understanding and learning opportunity of VLSI designing for users.
			There are ten experiments in this lab, which covers following aspects of VLSI designing.
			<br><br>
			<ol>
			<li>First six experiments provide GUI interface of schematic design and simulation results of various circuits.</li><br>
			<li>Seventh experiment provides WEB based Spice code simulation platform. User can learn circuit design using Spice coding.</li><br>
			<li>Eighth and ninth experiments provide digital circuit designing using Verilog code for which a web based Verilog simulation 
				platform is provided. User can test any level of Verilog code in ninth experiment.</li><br>
			<li>Tenth experiment provides GUI interface of physical (layout) design of various circuits. By this experiment user can learn design rules 
				(DRCs) for layout design and can test design rules of their designs.</li><br>
