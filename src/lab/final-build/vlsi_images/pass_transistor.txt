A multiplexer selects one of many analog or digital input .A multiplexer with 2^n input lines 
have n select lines.The select lines can either be 0 or 1.Depending on the binary number(formed by combination 
of 1's and 0's) at the select lines.One of the input is selected and it is passed on to the
output.
The block diagram and truth table of the 2 input multiplexer is given below:
The logical expression for output can be AS0'+BS0 if we implement this logic using nands and nors 
then no. of transistor required would be 5.We can use the knowledge of pass transistors,control variables an
pass variables.

* Choice of control variable and pass variable??
  Select input should be the control variable and data inputs can act as pass variables
  
* wether to use nmos/pmos pass transistor ??
  
   Since nmos is preferable in passing logic 0 and pmos is preffered in passing logic 1.We use 
   a combination of both with complementing control variables.This ensures that both are on simultaneously
   and any value applied at the input appears at the output

diagram when so is 1
diagram when so is 0

The block diagram and truth table for 4 input multiplexer is given below:
