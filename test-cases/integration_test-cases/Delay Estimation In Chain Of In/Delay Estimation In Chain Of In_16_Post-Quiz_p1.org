* Objective
  - To perform the Virtual Experiment of the Delay Estimation In Chain Of Inverters experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/vlsi-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Delay Estimation In Chain Of In/Delay Estimation In Chain Of In_01_Usability_smk.org][Delay Estimation In Chain Of In_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Virtual Experiment link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Virtual Experiment page
  3. Click on the 'Experiment' link
  4. Select a PMO from the available icons displayed on the screen
  5. Click on the black screen to put the selected PMO on it 
  6. Using 4&5 steps, in the similar way as PMO, do for NMO,Capacitor,Ground,Vadd,Input,Output
  7. Select the wire and using the wire connect the components to form the circuit
  8. Select Gate sizing from the dropdown displayed on the screen
  9. Click on the Simulator button
  10. Click on the components to change the properties and then click on OK button

* Expected result
  1. Virtual Experiment page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A new tab should be opened with the simulation process
  4. The selected PMO,NMO,Capacitor,Ground,Vadd,Input,Output should be displayed in the selected icon box
  5. The selected size should be displayed on the screen and when we click on the simulator button, the simulation output should be displayed on the screen
  6. The simulation output should be displayed on the screen with the modified properties
