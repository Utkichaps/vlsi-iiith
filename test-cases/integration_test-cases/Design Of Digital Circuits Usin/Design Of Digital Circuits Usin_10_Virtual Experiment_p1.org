* Objective
  - To perform the Virtual Experiment of the Design Of Digital Circuits Using Verilog experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/vlsi-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Design Of Digital Circuits Usin/Design Of Digital Circuits Usin_01_Usability_smk.org][Design Of Digital Circuits Usin_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Virtual Experiment link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Virtual Experiment page
  3. Click on the 'Experiment' link
  4. Click on OR Gate Verilog 
  5. Click on OR Gate Testbench Code
  6. Don't insert the code in OR Gate Verilog and OR Gate Testbench boxes and click on simulation button

* Expected result
  1. Virtual Experiment page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A new tab should be opened with the simulation process
  4. The OR Gate Verilog and OR Gate Testbench Codes should be displayed on the screen
  5. An error page should be displayed on the screen as to insert the valid code in the OR Gate Verilog and OR Gate Testbench box

* Review/comments
