* Objective
  - To perform the Virtual Experiment of the Spice Code Platform experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/vlsi-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Spice Code Platform/Spice Code Platform_01_Usability_smk.org][Spice Code Platform_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Virtual Experiment link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Virtual Experiment page
  3. Click on the 'Experiment' link
  4. Click on the  Inverter Spice Code, Nand Spice Code and NOR Spice Code respectively
  5. Don't insert the code in the box and click on simulation button

* Expected result
  1. Virtual Experiment page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A new tab should be opened with the simulation process
  4. The selected Inverter Spice Code, Nand Spice Code and NOR Spice Code should be displayed on the screen respectively
  5. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to enter the valid code in the corresponding field
