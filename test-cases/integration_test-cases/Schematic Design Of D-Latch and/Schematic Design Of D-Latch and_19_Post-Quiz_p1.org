* Objective
  - To perform the Virtual     Start the Negative Edge D-FlipFlop Experiment of the Schematic Design Of D-Latch and D-Flip Flop     Start the Negative Edge D-FlipFlop Experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/vlsi-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Schematic Design Of D-Latch and/Schematic Design Of D-Latch and_01_Usability_smk.org][Schematic Design Of D-Latch and_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Virtual     Start the Negative Edge D-FlipFlop Experiment link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Virtual     Start the Negative Edge D-FlipFlop Experiment page
  3. Click on the '    Start the Negative Edge D-FlipFlop Experiment' link
  4. Select a PMO from the available icons displayed on the screen
  5. Click on the black screen to put the selected PMO on it and click on simulation button

* Expected result
  1. Virtual     Start the Negative Edge D-FlipFlop Experiment page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A new tab should be opened with the simulation process
  4. The selected PMO should be displayed in the selected icon box
  5. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to complete the circuit
