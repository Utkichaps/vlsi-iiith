* Objective
  - To perform the Virtual     Start the Positive Level D-Latch and D-FlipFlop Experiment of the Schematic Design Of D-Latch and D-Flip Flop     Start the Positive Level D-Latch and D-FlipFlop Experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/vlsi-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Schematic Design Of D-Latch and/Schematic Design Of D-Latch and_01_Usability_smk.org][Schematic Design Of D-Latch and_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Virtual     Start the Positive Level D-Latch and D-FlipFlop Experiment link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Virtual     Start the Positive Level D-Latch and D-FlipFlop Experiment page
  3. Click on the '    Start the Positive Level D-Latch and D-FlipFlop Experiment' link
  4. Select a PMO from the available icons displayed on the screen
  5. Click on the black screen to put the selected PMO on it 
  6. Using 4&5 steps, in the similar way as PMO, do for NMO,Capacitor,Ground,Vadd,Input,Output
  7. Select the wire and using the wire connect the components to form the circuit
  8. Select D-Latch negative level from the dropdown displayed on the screen
  9. Click on the Simulator button ad click on the layout design button
  10. Click on the components to change the properties and then click on OK button

* Expected result
  1. Virtual     Start the Positive Level D-Latch and D-FlipFlop Experiment page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. A new tab should be opened with the simulation process
  4. The selected PMO,NMO,Capacitor,Ground,Vadd,Input,Output should be displayed in the selected icon box
  5. The selected level should be displayed on the screen and when we click on the simulator button, the simulation output Graphs should be displayed on the screen
  6. The layout design should be displayed on the screen
  7. The simulation output Graphs should be displayed on the screen with the modified properties
